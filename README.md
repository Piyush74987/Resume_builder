# Resume Builder Web Application

## Description:
Developed a responsive web application that allows users to create, customize, and download their resumes. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, providing a clean, user-friendly interface with real-time preview functionality.

## Key Features:

### Dynamic Form Inputs:
Users can input their personal information, education, work experience, skills, and other details through dynamically generated forms.
Real-time Preview: The resume preview updates in real-time as users fill out the form, allowing them to see how their resume will look.
Template Selection: Implemented multiple resume templates that users can select from, offering various styles and layouts.
Download as PDF: Integrated a feature that allows users to download their completed resume as a PDF file.
Responsive Design: Ensured that the application is fully responsive, working seamlessly across different screen sizes and devices.

### Technologies Used:
HTML5: Structured the content and layout of the application.
CSS3: Styled the application with a focus on modern, clean design, and implemented responsive design using media queries.
JavaScript (Vanilla): Managed user inputs, real-time updates, and implemented features like template switching and PDF generation.

## Challenges & Solutions:
PDF Generation: Initially, creating a seamless PDF export was challenging due to layout issues. This was resolved by using the jsPDF library combined with custom JavaScript to ensure the exported PDF closely matches the on-screen preview.
State Management: Maintaining the state of the user inputs across different sections was managed using JavaScript objects and local storage, ensuring data persistence even if the user navigates away from the page.

## Outcome:
Successfully built a functional and user-friendly resume builder that has been well-received by users. This project demonstrates my ability to build interactive and dynamic web applications using core web technologies.
